# Mobile App &lt;&gt; Node Monitoring

## General

This is a free monitoring tool provided by [beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in/) to enhance the solo staking experience. The user specifies the monitoring endpoint on its beacon & validator node.

_By using this endpoint, beaconcha.in will be allowed and is required to store the given data to display it in the beaconcha.in the mobile application. To protect user privacy, the IP address will **never** be stored._  


### **Requirements**

* beaconcha.in [Account](https://beaconcha.in/register) 
* beaconcha.in [Mobile App](https://beaconcha.in/mobile) 
* **Lighthouse**  [**v.1.4.0**](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases) or higher
* **Prysm** [**v1.3.10**](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/releases) or higher
* Staking on Linux \(No windows support by clients yet!\)

1. Head over to the [user settings](https://beaconcha.in/user/settings) on beaconcha.in 
2. Open the **Mobile App** Tab and enter a name for your staking setup.  _Use the same worker name even if your beaconnode runs on a seperate machine than your validator node._ 
3. Make sure your **prysm.sh** file is updated and supports client-stats Updated version: [https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/develop/prysm.sh](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/blob/develop/prysm.sh) 
4. Open an extra terminal next to your validator and beacon-node and modify **YOUR-API-KEY** and **DEVICE-NAME**  


   _Use the same worker name even if your beaconnode runs on a seperate machine than your validator node._

  
   `./prysm.sh client-stats --beacon-node-metrics-url=`[`http://localhost:8080/metrics`](http://localhost:8080/metrics) `--validator-metrics-url=`[`http://localhost:8081/metrics`](http://localhost:8081/metrics) `--clientstats-api-url=https://beaconcha.in/api/v1/stats/`**`<YOUR-API-KEY>`**`/`**`<DEVICE-NAME>`**
